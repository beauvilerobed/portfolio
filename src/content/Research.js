                                        <p>
                                        In 1981, Dale Alspach produced the first example of a non-expansive mapping T
                                            on a weakly compact convex subset of a Banach space that is fixed point-free. Using Zornâ€™s
                                            lemma, there exists a minimally weak compact, convex subset of which is T-invariant and
                                            fixed point free. I investigate special closed linear spans that "should" contains a copy of
                                            Lebesgue integrable functions on the unit interval.
                                            of G-frames in terms of G-Riesz bases.                                        
                                        </p>
                                    <h3><strong>Frame and Generalized Frames</strong></h3>
                                        <p>
                                        Wenchang Sun introduced
                                            generalized frames and included ordinary frames. I currently use many ideas from Operator
                                            Theory to show characterizations of Frames in terms of Riesz bases and characterizations
                                            of G-frames in terms of G-Riesz bases.                              
                                        </p>

                                        <p>I am also studying how the theory of finite normalized tight frames (FNTFs) is developed in Hilbert 
                                            spaces (both finite and infinite-dimensional). An influential theorem is the characterization of all 
                                            FNTFs in terms of the minima of a potential energy function. This was designed to measure the total 
                                            orthogonality of a Bessel sequence. I am particularly interested in their connections in Deep Learning 
                                            and Sparse Approximation. One fascinating connection is the deep frame potential: it's a measure of 
                                            coherence that is approximately related to representation stability but has minimizers based solely on 
                                            the network structure.
